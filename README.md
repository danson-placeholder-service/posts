# Danson Placeholder Service - POSTS

This is a service for a project I'm building similar to JsonPlaceholder Service. 

## Getting Started 

To run the project you will need docker desktop running. The `compose.yaml` file is processed by Spring Boot on
startup and automatically runs `docker compose up` for you. 

- There is a test suite in `/src/test/java/`
- There are Swagger Docs at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
